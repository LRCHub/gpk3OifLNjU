[00:14.44] Come and fly away with me
[00:16.91] Come and fly away with me
[00:20.08] Come and fly away with me
[00:23.27] Come and fly away with me
[00:35.77] 
[00:26.32] Come and fly away with me
[00:29.33] Come and fly away with me
[00:32.42] Come and fly away with me
[00:35.11] C-C-Come and fly away with me
[00:49.61] 
[00:51.49] Don't you be afraid
[00:52.41] Everything will change, you and I
[00:54.23] Jumping of the edge
[00:55.47] Say that dreamers never die
[00:57.35] So, come and fly, come and fly
[00:58.92] Come and fly away with me
[01:11.42] 
[01:03.62] Don't you be afraid
[01:04.88] Everything will change, you and I
[01:06.79] Jumping of the edge
[01:08.60] Say that dreamers never die
[01:09.63] So, come and fly, come and fly
[01:11.36] Come and fly away with me
[01:23.86] 
[01:29.16] We're rising, we're falling
[01:32.19] We'll make it through
[01:35.22] We're climbing, we're soaring
[01:38.38] A thousand views
[01:46.38] 
[01:44.28] Somewhere by the Emerald Sea
[01:47.46] Where the moon and water meet
[01:50.53] Somewhere close to harmony
[01:53.63] When the world is sound asleep
[02:08.63] 
[01:56.84] Something's gonna bring a change
[01:59.87] Journeys we are meant to take
[02:02.95] Something at the edge of space
[02:06.09] Calling us to fly away
[02:17.09] 
[02:09.18] Don't you be afraid
[02:10.23] Everything will change, you and I
[02:12.46] Jumping of the edge
[02:13.40] Say that dreamers never die
[02:15.07] So, come and fly, come and fly
[02:16.99] Come and fly away with me
[02:18.61] (Come and fly, come and fly)
[02:20.07] (Come and fly away with me)
[02:33.57] 
[02:21.70] Don't you be afraid
[02:22.85] Everything will change, you and I
[02:24.84] Jumping of the edge
[02:25.95] Say that dreamers never die
[02:27.57] So, come and fly, come and fly
[02:29.47] Come and fly away with me
[02:41.97] 
[02:47.04] We're rising, we're falling
[02:50.07] We'll make it through
[02:53.27] We're climbing, we're soaring
[02:56.38] A thousand views
[03:04.38] 
[02:59.63] We're rising, we're falling
[03:02.53] We'll make it through
[03:05.68] We're climbing, we're soaring
[03:08.76] A thousand views
[03:16.76] 
[03:11.62] Come and fly away with me
[03:14.77] Come and fly away with me
[03:17.92] Come and fly away with me
[03:20.96] Come and fly away with me
[03:33.46] 
[03:24.10] Come and fly away with me
[03:27.27] Come and fly away with me
[03:30.33] Come and fly away with me
[03:33.66] Come and fly away with me
